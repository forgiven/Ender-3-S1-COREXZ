# Ender 3 S1 COREXZ

Created initial version that works, able to print using current STLs, needs improvement.

Klipper still uses the input-shaping / pressure advance from the original lead screw z-axis setup. I will measure resonances and update the pressure advance once I have more solid corexz mounts.

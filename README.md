# Ender 3 S1 COREXZ

## Version 1.0

### Updated STLs to version 1.0

The parts should be printed in PETG or something equally or more stable (see: https://www.simplify3d.com/support/materials-guide/properties-table/)

- PETG (I used SUNLU black)
- Layer height: 0.25 first layer, 0.25 all layers
- 4 external perimeters, 0.8mm wall thickness
- 50% grid infill
- Supports (support enforcers only), snug supports (SuperSlicer)
    - See print orientation / supports used below


## List of materials
You can have a look in the `BOM.xlsx`


### All designed by me using cad.onshape.com

Created initial version that works, able to print using current STLs, needs improvement.

Klipper still uses the input-shaping / pressure advance from the original lead screw z-axis setup. I will measure resonances and update the pressure advance once I have more solid corexz mounts.

Improved gantry mounts (printed with original COREXZ setup :), made it more solid and printed in PETG.
- 0.2mm layer height
- external perimeter speed 125mm/s
- other 200mm/s
